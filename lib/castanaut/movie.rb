=== Writing screenplays
You write your screenplays as Ruby files. Castanaut has been designed to 
read fairly naturally to the non-technical, within Ruby's constraints.

Here's a simple screenplay:
  plugin "safari"
  launch "Safari", at(32, 32, 800, 600)
  url "http://www.google.com"
  pause 4
  move to_element('input[name="q"]')
  click
  type "Castanaut"
  move to_element('input[type="submit"]')
  click
  pause 4
  say "Oh. I was hoping for more results."
  say "Infact it looks good!", "Whisper"
=== Available system voices
#{voice_names.inspect}
=== You are listening voice "Cellos" now if available on your system.
EOS
				say "Dum dum dum dum dum dum dum he he he ho ho ho fa lah lah lah lah lah lah fa lah full hoo hoo hoo", "Cellos"
				say "Sorry if your speaker is too loud.", "whisper"
			  exit status
		end
